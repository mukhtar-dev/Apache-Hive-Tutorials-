Introduction 

This assignment will test your skills on HiveQL commands and scripting concepts learnt in 
the Live Class. You need to use the HiveQL commands to analyse the stocks data from a 
‘New York Stock Exchange’ 
dataset and calculate the covariance for a stock. 

Data set: 
This dataset is s a comma separated file (CSV) named 
‘NYSE_daily_prices_Q.csv’ that 
contains the stock information such as daily quotes etc. at 
New York Stock Exchange
 
Covariance:
 This finance term represents the degree or amount that two stocks
or financial instruments move together or apart from each other. With covariance, investors have the 
opportunity to seek out different investment options based upon their respective risk profile. 
It is a statistical measure of how one investment moves in 
relation to another. 

- A positive covariance means that asset returns moved together. If investment instruments 
  or stocks tend to be up or down during the same time periods, they have positive 
  covariance. 
- A negative covariance means returns move inversely. If one investment tends to be up 
 while the other is down, they have negative covariance.


Problem statement
Use HiveQL to analyse the stock exchange dataset and calculate the covariance between the 
stocks for each month. This will help a stock br
oker in recommending the stocks to his 
customers. 
After completing the task, you can review the solution in your LMS.
